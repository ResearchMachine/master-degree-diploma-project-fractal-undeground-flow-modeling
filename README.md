# Undeground Flow in Fractal Media Modeling 
2018

### I. About. 
Company: Ufa State Aviation Technical University (link), Master Degree Diploma Project. Programming language: Maple 18. 
Two approaches are considered for artificial examples: power-law approach, F^$\alpha$-approach. For the first case, the problem of determining new parameters is solved. For the second case, the model was deduced and physical consistency was shown.





### II. Motivation.
Reservoir zones with impaired permeability can, like many other systems with a disordered structure, have fractal properties. Thus, the relevance of the chosen research topic is the benefit of taking into account the fractal properties of the medium in poorly permeable reservoir zones.

The main advantage of the work is the development of the theory of filtration in media with fractal characteristics.


### III. Content.

Models of one-dimensional undeground flow in media with fractal properties are investigated. The main purpose of this work is to investigate several approaches of including fractal properties of medium into the filtration models. 
The problems of finding the Hausdorff permeability parameter from the pres-sure value in the one-phase filtration models, that is derived in the view of the step function, are solved. Buckley-Leverett two-phase filtration models and capillary imbibition models are generalized with the usage of the power laws. Fractal differential calculus approach showed significant difference between the solutions of boundary value prob-lems for stationary filtration models with and without fractal geometry.

The project code contains 3 scripts:
1. Solution of fractal properties identification problem for a steady model;
2. Solution of fractal properties identification problem for a non-steady model;
3. The Monte Carlo algorithm of the fractal mass function, construction of a continuously parameterized Koch curve.


Section 1 is devoted to a brief review of the main concepts and methods used in the work. The main models of filtration, the approach of taking into account the fractality of the medium through power laws, and differential calculus on a fractal set are described.

Section 2 is devoted to the justification of the application of power laws in the geometric parameters of single-phase one-dimensional mathematical models of filtration in the case of a power trend in their distributions, using the example of the Cantor ladder. 2 boundary value problems for one-dimensional model (steady and non-steady case) of single-phase flow are considered. In the first case, a step function with a power trend is taken as the permeability. In the second case, the permeability is equal to a power function. Based on the solutions of these boundary value problems, the functional of the difference of solutions is constructed and minimized. 

Section 3 is devoted to the generalization of two-phase filtration models to the case of fractal media using power laws. Analytical solutions are found for the generalized Buckley-Leverett model. For the impregnation model, a self-similar replacement is found, which reduces the original partial differential equation to an ordinary differential equation. The resulting ordinary equation is solved numerically using the Maple 18 software package.

Section 4 is devoted to the generalization of the mathematical model of stationary filtration to the case of other fractal media. For this, differential calculus on fractals is used. For the new model, the first boundary value problem is also solved.
